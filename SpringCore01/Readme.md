There are 2 ways to use spring framework(Spring Core) one is by using Application Context and Bean Factory. <br>
Here in this repo we will see the ApplicationContext approch. <br>
Here we will need a configuration file/Instructions which is a xml file only. <br>
We will give the instructions to the container which is cretaed from Application context. <br>
The dependency injection will be taken care by The continer only. <br>

**Eager initilization**
Even though we are not using all objects but spring is creating objcts for all.So in ApplicationContext it is always eager intilization.
