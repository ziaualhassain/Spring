There are 2 ways to use spring framework(Spring Core) one is by using Application Context and Bean Factory. <br>
Here in this repo we will see the ApplicationContext approch.
Here we will need a configuration file/Instructions which is a xml file only.
We will give the instructions to the container which is cretaed from Application context.
The dependency injection will be taken care by The continer only.
